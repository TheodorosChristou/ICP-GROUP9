# Testing `_app` Component

## Description
This test suite aims to verify the behavior of the `MyApp` component.

## Setup
- The `render` function, `screen` object, and `waitFor` function are imported from `@testing-library/react`.
- The `MyApp` component is imported from `@/pages/_app`.
- A mock service worker is set up using Jest's mocking capabilities.
- The `sw` module is mocked to simulate the service worker.
## Test Dependencies
- **Dependencies:**
  - `@testing-library/react`: Provides utilities for testing React components.
  - `@/pages/_app`: The `MyApp` component to be tested.
  - `jest`: Testing framework for JavaScript projects.
## Test Cases

### 1. Renders Children Components
- **Description:** Tests whether `MyApp` renders its child components correctly.
- **Test Steps:**
  1. Render the `MyApp` component with a mock child component.
  2. Check if the mock child component is present in the rendered output.
- **Expected Behavior:** The mock child component should be rendered successfully.

### 2. Registers Service Worker on Mount
- **Description:** Tests whether `MyApp` registers the service worker when mounted.
- **Test Steps:**
  1. Render the `MyApp` component.
  2. Wait for the service worker registration process to complete.
  3. Verify if the service worker registration function is called with the correct URL.
- **Expected Behavior:** The service worker registered with the specified URL (`/sw.js`) during component mount.
