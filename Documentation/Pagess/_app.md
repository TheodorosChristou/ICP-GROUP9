import Heading from "@/components/Heading";
import Header from "../components/Header";
import "../styles/globals.css";
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider} from "react-query"
import { SessionProvider } from "next-auth/react"
import { useEffect } from 'react';
import GoogleAnalytics from "@/components/GoogleAnalytics";
import ConsentPopup from '../components/CookieConsent'
import WeatherPage from '../pages/weatherpage'

## Query Client

The MyApp component renders the entire application. It sets up session management, global elements, and wraps the main content.

## Implementation

- Registers a service worker for offline capabilities if the browser supports it.

- Wraps the application with SessionProvider to manage authentication session.

- Sets up the layout with the header, heading, Google Analytics, and consent popup.

- Renders the main component with its props.

```tsx
function MyApp({ Component, pageProps: { session, ...pageProps } }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
      navigator.serviceWorker.register('/sw.js').then(
        function (registration) {
          console.log('Service Worker registration successful with scope: ', registration.scope);
        },
        function (err) {
          console.log('Service Worker registration failed: ', err);
        }
      );
    }
  }, []);

  return (
    <SessionProvider session={session}>
      <div className="bg-white min-h-screen pt-[64px] overflow-x-hidden global-bg">
